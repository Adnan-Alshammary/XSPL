# "index" and "scan": 

query can start by either index attribute or scan command.

### index:
index is the path for the log file or registry key. a registry must contains "::" as separator between root key and the path. 

examples:

`index="C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx"`

`index="hkcu::Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce"`

`index="hklm::system\CurrentControlSet\Services"`

conditions can be written in different ways:

`index="C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx" (EventID="1" OR EventID="2") `

or

`index="C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx" EventID IN ("1","2") `

Notes: 
- keyword between conditions such as "AND", "OR", "IN" should be written in upper-case
- you can use wildcard conditions in the query without specifying the field name  ` "cmd.exe" OR "powershell" `


### scan:
scan command is used to perform search for file in disk or process in memory.

syntax:
`scan  {"Hex_regex"}  "String_Regex"`

options:
- directory: can be directory or specific file path or "memory" for memory scanning. default is current directory
- max_size: avoid file or memory regions greater than this option. to perform full scan  max_size="-1"
- depth: this option used with directory file scanning to put limit for recursive search. default is 0 which means search in the provided directory only. to perform full recursive search you can use depth="-1"

   
examples:

- scan memory and extract strings that contains "http":

`scan directory="memory" "http"`

- scan specific file and extract strings that contains "http":

`scan directory="C:\Users\adnan\Desktop\pwshem\HxD.exe" "http"`

- scan a directory and extract string contains "http" from executable files only:

`scan directory="C:\Users\adnan\Desktop\" "http"  {"^4d5a"} `


# "stats":

stats command is used to calculate statistics such as average, sum or standard deviation.

syntax:

`stats <FUNCTIONS>  <BY>  <FIELD_NAMES>`


available functions:
- count
- dc (or distinct_count)
- avg (or average)
- range
- max
- min
- stdev
- mode
- list
- values
- sum
- median
- mean
- var
- first
- last

exmples: 

```
index="C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx" EventID="1" 
| stats values(Image) as all_Child_proc count by  ParentImage
```

Notes:
- each statistical function must receive one argument except "count" can be used without argument
- you can rename the result field of statistical function using the "as" keywork:  `values(Image) as all_Child_proc`
- when you used "by" clause, one row is returned for each distinct value in the field specified in the "by" clause



# "eventstats":

similar to stats function. the main deffierence is that eventstats does not change the incoming result, it only add the result to it. eventstats support same functions in stats command.

exmples: 

```
index="C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx" EventID="1" 
| eventstats values(Image) as all_Child_proc count by  ParentImage
```


# "streamtstats":
incrementaly adds a cumulative statistical value to each event in the result. it support same functions in stats and eventstats.

options:
- current: "true" or "false" to includes the current event in the summary calculations. Default is "true"
- window: the number of events to use when computing the statistics. The default is window="-1" to include all events 
- global: "true" or "false" and used only if window option is set. it determine if a separate window is used for each group of values of the field specified in the by clause. Default is "true"
